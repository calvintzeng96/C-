# C# NOTES

### semicolin should be at end of every line
### console.log("msg") => Console.WriteLine("msg")
### uses pascal case for methods
### uses camel case for variables
### variable char wrapped in SINGLE quotes
### variable string wrapped in DOUBLE quotes
### variable declaration starts with type (int, double, char, string, bool)
### can add "const" before variable type
### *can use var instead of const, but no type needed (weird concept...?)

## number types:
### int - integers, no need to explain
### double - takes up to 7 digits after ".", most used data type(supposedly)
### float - takes up to 15 digits after ".", use in situations that can take rounding errs
### decimal - takes up to 28 digits after ".", lot slower than double/float, higher level accuracy, avoid rounding errs
